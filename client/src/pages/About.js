                Standing precariously on the drab brown step stool, Ms
                Willenson, my second grade teacher, adjusted my drawing of a
                circular, grey owl on the library wall. Having your artwork hung
                in the school library meant you were big cheese at Donges Bay
                Elementary school in Wisconsin! I remember what a great day that
                was and the very first inklings I had of wanting to be an artist
                when I grew up.

                I went on to earn my BFA defgree in studio arts from the
                University of Wisconsin, Stevents Point in 1983. I also studied
                art at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design, the Associates
                of Art in Sherman Oaks, CA and studied under Margo Lennartz in
                La Crescenta, CA.

                All these years later I still love drawing owls, although not
                quite as rotund, along with all sorts of other amazing
                crittersâ€¦they are a never ending source of inspiration in my
                art. Capturing the essence and soul of each animal I draw, along
                with their spirit and beauty are integral facets in each drawing
                I create. 
            </MarginP>
            <MarginP>
                I hope my art inspires each viewer to realize their connection
                to all living things, and to have a positive impact on this
                planet so that together we can help preserve the exquisite
                complexity of our earth for many years to come. 
                With the sale of each original drawing a portion of the sale is
                donated to a favorite charity or rescue. Some of my favorites
                are the California Wildlife Center, Animals Asia Foundation, the
                David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, and Old Friends Senior Dog
                Sanctuary, to name just a few.

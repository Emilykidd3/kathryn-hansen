## About the Project

### User Story

```
AS AN artist
I WANT to be able to showcase my art, add new art, and share events with potential buyers
SO THAT I can increase my art sales
```

### Description

Kathryn Hansen is a California based artist that specializes in graphite and colored pencil drawings. She sells her art through a 3rd party online store. Her current website is outdated, and makes it challenging for potential buyers to get to her online store. Also, the gallery included artwork that she is no longer selling.

Her new website is streamlined, modern, and allows users to easily purchase her art. It also allows her to more visibly share her upcoming events to increase her potential client base. It is also configured for mobile devices.

Finally, Kathryn's administrative dashboard is easy to use, and allows her to quickly add upcoming events and new art to her website.

### Built With

- Express

## Usage

Kathryn's website contains an About, Gallery, Contact form, and Events page. The footer of her website also allows potential buyers to connect with her via social media and to sign up for her newsletter.

The About page includes links to podcasts that she has been a guest on in addition to more information about her. The Gallery page contains images of all the artwork she is selling and direct links to purchase it. If an item is not available for purchase, they can use the contact form to contact her about the art piece. The Contact form allows visitors to contact her directly. Finally, the events page shows upcoming events that Kathryn will be sharing her artwork. There is also a direct link to her online store through the Shop navigation link.

Kathryn also has access to her admin dashboard, where is she is able to log in and add new art and events. While logged in she is also able to update and delete.
